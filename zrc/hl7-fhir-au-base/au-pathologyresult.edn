This profile is intended to be capable of supporting reporting for all pathology disciplines (e.g. including microbiology, histopathology, cytology, blood transfusion) with the exception of genomics. The observation may represent the result of a simple test such as haemoglobin or it may group the set of results produced by a multi-test study or panel such as a full blood count, or urine specimen study.\n\nThis profile does not provide full support for structured pathology reporting. It is expected that this support is best handled by a set of profiles that represent the structured reporting requirements for each specific protocol (see for example [RCPAâ€™s structured pathology reporting of cancer](https://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Structured-Pathology-Reporting-of-Cancer)); this is not in the scope of this implementation guide at this time.",
